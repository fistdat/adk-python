# Introduction to Conversational Context: Session, State, and Memory [¶](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/sessions/\#introduction-to-conversational-context-session-state-and-memory "Permanent link")

## Why Context Matters [¶](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/sessions/\#why-context-matters "Permanent link")

Meaningful, multi-turn conversations require agents to understand context. Just like humans, they need to recall what's been said and done to maintain continuity and avoid repetition. The Agent Development Kit (ADK) provides structured ways to manage this context through `Session`, `State`, and `Memory`.

## Core Concepts [¶](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/sessions/\#core-concepts "Permanent link")

Think of interacting with your agent as having distinct **conversation threads**, potentially drawing upon **long-term knowledge**.

1. **`Session`**: The Current Conversation Thread
   - Represents a _single, ongoing interaction_ between a user and your agent system.
   - Contains the chronological sequence of messages and actions ( `Events`) for _that specific interaction_.
   - A `Session` can also hold temporary data ( `State`) relevant only _during this conversation_.
2. **`State` ( `session.state`)**: Data Within the Current Conversation
   - Data stored within a specific `Session`.
   - Used to manage information relevant _only_ to the _current, active_ conversation thread (e.g., items in a shopping cart _during this chat_, user preferences mentioned _in this session_).
3. **`Memory`**: Searchable, Cross-Session Information
   - Represents a store of information that might span _multiple past sessions_ or include external data sources.
   - It acts as a knowledge base the agent can _search_ to recall information or context beyond the immediate conversation.

## Managing Context: Services [¶](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/sessions/\#managing-context-services "Permanent link")

ADK provides services to manage these concepts:

1. **`SessionService`**: Manages Conversation Threads ( `Session` objects)
   - Handles the lifecycle: creating, retrieving, updating (appending `Events`, modifying `State`), and deleting individual `Session` threads.
   - Ensures the agent has the right history and state for the current turn.
2. **`MemoryService`**: Manages the Long-Term Knowledge Store ( `Memory`)
   - Handles ingesting information (often from completed `Session` s) into the long-term store.
   - Provides methods to search this stored knowledge based on queries.

**Implementations**: ADK offers different implementations for both `SessionService` and `MemoryService`, allowing you to choose the storage backend that best fits your application's needs. Notably, **in-memory implementations** are provided for both services; these are designed specifically for **local quick testing and development**. It's important to remember that **all data stored using these in-memory options (sessions, state, or long-term knowledge) is lost when your application restarts**. For persistence and scalability beyond local testing, ADK also offers database and cloud-based service options.

**In Summary:**

- **`Session` & `State`**: Focus on the **here and now** – the history and temporary data of the _single, active conversation_. Managed primarily by `SessionService`.
- **Memory**: Focuses on the **past and external information** – a _searchable archive_ potentially spanning across conversations. Managed by `MemoryService`.

## What's Next? [¶](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/sessions/\#whats-next "Permanent link")

In the following sections, we'll dive deeper into each of these components:

- **`Session`**: Understanding its structure and `Events`.
- **`State`**: How to effectively read, write, and manage session-specific data.
- **`SessionService`**: Choosing the right storage backend for your sessions.
- **`MemoryService`**: Exploring options for storing and retrieving broader context.

Understanding these concepts is fundamental to building agents that can engage in complex, stateful, and context-aware conversations.
