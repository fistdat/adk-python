## Notes
- Each page was saved in both Markdown format (for easy reading) and original HTML (for reference)
- Some directories (like `api-reference/`) were created but remain empty as their content wasn't crawled
- The initial firecrawl_crawl attempt had some issues, so individual pages were scraped using firecrawl_scrape
- All content was downloaded to local storage as requested

## Next Steps
To complete the crawl of the entire ADK documentation, you might want to:
1. Crawl additional pages like tutorials, API reference, and specific agent/tool documentation
2. Download any assets (images, diagrams) referenced in the documentation
3. Consider using a more comprehensive crawling approach to get all pages automatically
