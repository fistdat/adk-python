# Agent Development Kit

**An open-source AI agent framework integrated with Gemini and Google**

## What is Agent Development Kit? [¶](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/\#what-is-agent-development-kit "Permanent link")

Agent Development Kit (ADK) is a flexible and modular framework for **developing**
**and deploying AI agents**. ADK can be used with popular LLMs and open-source
generative AI tools and is designed with a focus on **tight integration with the**
**Google ecosystem and Gemini models**. ADK makes it **easy to get started with**
**simple agents** powered by Gemini models and Google AI tools while providing the
control and structure needed for **more complex agent architectures and**
**orchestration**.

Get started:


`pip install google-adk`

- **Flexible Orchestration**


* * *


Define workflows using workflow agents ( `Sequential`, `Parallel`, `Loop`)
for predictable pipelines, or leverage LLM-driven dynamic routing
( `LlmAgent` transfer) for adaptive behavior.

[**Learn about agents**](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/agents/)

- **Multi-Agent Architecture**


* * *


Build modular and scalable applications by composing multiple specialized
agents in a hierarchy. Enable complex coordination and delegation.

[**Explore multi-agent systems**](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/agents/multi-agents/)

- **Rich Tool Ecosystem**


* * *


Equip agents with diverse capabilities: use pre-built tools (Search, Code
Exec), create custom functions, integrate 3rd-party libraries (LangChain,
CrewAI), or even use other agents as tools.

[**Browse tools**](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/tools/)

- **Deployment Ready**


* * *


Containerize and deploy your agents anywhere – run locally, scale with
Vertex AI Agent Engine, or integrate into custom infrastructure using Cloud
Run or Docker.

[**Deploy agents**](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/deploy/)

- **Built-in Evaluation**


* * *


Systematically assess agent performance by evaluating both the final
response quality and the step-by-step execution trajectory against
predefined test cases.

[**Evaluate agents**](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/evaluate/)

- **Building Responsible Agents**


* * *


Learn how to building powerful and trustworthy agents by implementing
responsible AI patterns and best practices into your agent's design.
